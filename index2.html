        <p class="text-muted text-left"> It is a Really great Bar inside a big Resort called Heritage village Resorts and spa , Goa.
            The Bar had 2 places where it was working , 1 was in the swimming pool i mean like a bar in the swimming pool is really cool you can dring a bit of pepsi or sprite while staying in the pool but you have to be careful not to drop it inside the pool. The second place where the bar is in the original Blue lagoon bar it has many 4-seat tables and some high chairs along the front of the bar , they serve soft drinks , juices , alcohol , and mocktails and cocktails. We could have breakfast, lunch , dinner for free in the restaurant because we booked a plan that came with all of that and the drinks like the alcohol and soft drinks were also free , So it was good buying that plan.
